Real Software Engineering

Software engineering as it's taught in universities simply doesn't work. It
doesn't produce software systems of high quality, and it doesn't produce them
for low cost. Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously, it doesn't produce
systems at all.

That's odd, because in every other field, the term "engineering" is reserved
for methods that work.

What then, does real software engineering look like? How can we consistently
deliver high-quality systems to our customers and employers in a timely fashion
and for a reasonable cost? In this session, we'll discuss where software
engineering went wrong, and build the case that disciplined Agile methods, far
from being "anti-engineering" (as they are often described), actually represent
the best of engineering principles applied to the task of software development.

For over 40 years, starting in the late 1960s, the "Software Engineering"crowd
has been telling us programmers that we need to get serious and learn how to be
real engineers. Most of their prescriptions resembled what we imagine a civil
engineer's day might be like: lots of formal methods, specification, diagrams
and other documents, design analysis and verification, and the like.

Many of us (including me) listened to that siren song for a while. But for each
of the many engineering disciplines, growing up has actually meant becoming
comfortable with what makes it unlike other disciplines. In software,
ironically enough, getting serious about being good engineers requires
rejecting almost everything we've been taught about "Software Engineering".
What engineering really means in the context of software is-as it ought to
be-very different from what other engineering disciplines practice.
